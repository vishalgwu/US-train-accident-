## Literature Review- 
Highway-railroad crossing accidents remain a criJcal safety concern in the U.S., 
causing significant fataliJes, injuries, and economic losses annually. Research 
highlights various contribuJng factors to these accidents, such as driver inaWenJon, 
risk-taking behaviors, and poor visibility during adverse weather condiJons (Liu et 
al., 2012). The disparity in size and weight between trains and vehicles exacerbates 
the severity of collisions, leading to serious injuries and fataliJes.
Improved technology and safety systems have proven effecJve in reducing 
accidents. Automated warning systems, enhanced signal systems, and risk 
reducJon measures, as highlighted by Arthur D. LiWle, Inc. (1996), play a crucial role 
in miJgaJng incidents. AddiJonally, studies on derailment factors emphasize the 
importance of infrastructure improvements and risk assessments in reducing 
hazardous material transportaJon risks (Barkan et al., 2003).

## Dataset Overview
The dataset, Jtled "Highway-Rail Grade Crossing Accident Data," was sourced 
from Kaggle and contains 46 years of historical data on railroad crossing incidents 
across the United States. IniJally, the dataset included 239,487 observaJons and 
141 variables. However, many variables were highly correlated, either presenJng 
the same features in different ways or conveying the same informaJon with slight 
variaJons. As a result, we removed the redundant columns. The final dataset now 
contains 120,365 observaJons and 46 variables, covering informaJon on railroad 
incidents, locaJon details, highway and crossing specifics, vehicle data, train 
informaJon, and environmental condiJons

## SMART Ques9ons
. How can we predict the severity of a driver’s injury in a railroad crossing 
accident using external factors?
2. How can we idenDfy accident-prone locaDons in the USA based on accident 
frequency over the past 46 years?
3. How can we predict the presence of crossing warning signs during railroad 
accidents using historical data?
